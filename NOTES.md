Undar was born to a Shaitan genie named Hormmud and his human slave Chelaxian concubine Juliasa on the Plane of Earth.  Hormmud was not eager to raise a child, so he tells Juliasa to remove Undar from his sight.

A dwarf living in Magnimar, by the name of Mezzin Oakbarrel, was working there as a brewer.  He had no kin, no family, and no heir.  In fact, he was the last of the Oakbarrel clan.  Living in Magnimar, there were no prospects either.  So Mezzin prayed to the Goddess Folgrit to give him a son.  Folgrit, also having received prayers from Juliasa, arranged a meeting with Hormmud, and convinced him to give Noah's character to Mezzin Oakbarrel for adoption.  Noah is delivered on the doorstep of Mezzin Oakbarrel without so much as a letter.  Many years later, Mezzin has enough money to open his own brewery in the newly formed town of Sandpoint named Old Light Ale, as the brewery was next to The Old Light tower.

After many years of raising Undar as his son in Sandpoint, Mezzin is assassinated by a madman (who had his mind taken over by Alaznist).  The brewery was burned to the ground, leaving Undar with just a few items to sell to raise money.  The mayor of Sandpoint, Kendra Devarin, was a friend of the family.  She convinced Undar that if he wants to feel safer, he should sell everything and move to the Windsong Abbey where it is quiet and arcane magic is scarce.

Undar travelled to Windsong Abbey, and met several denominations of churches, but was taken aback by the acceptance of the Church of Irori despite his Outsider nature.  He had always followed the Dwarven Gods as his father had, but Irori's priests and monks insisted that they could release his true potential.  He trained as a monk of Irori.  He learned the chakram as his favorite weapon, and learned to use his father's love of drink in his fighting style.  His masters begrudgingly accepted this, as he passed many beginner trials.  

Undar's master, Phin-Xae-Yi, tells Undar that time has come for him to leave the temple.  His last trial is to face his fear of arcane magic, and travel to Misret Manor to copy several books on meditation.  Phin-Xae-Yi senses that his help will be needed when he arrives at Misret Manor.  Once the copies are complete, he is to return them to receive his graduation sash, and the right open his own temple if he wishes.

The Iron Regent of Janderhoff, Axvi Shattershield, has been under pressure from Korvosa to stop sending iron shipments west to Magnimar and Riddleport.  The Five Kings have given the Iron Regent leeway to handle the situation in a subtle way.  Korvosa has already severely restricted shipments by levying huge taxes on all iron and steel going through their ports.  Now there is an implied threat of naked violence if shipments do not stop via the newly formed "Iron Road" from Janderhoff to Riddleport that goes through Korvosan territory.  Rather than risk open war or economic sactions from Korvosa, Axvi is going to try to open another point of production.

Regent Axvi sent an emissary, Toma Shattershield (2nd nephew) with seed money (5000 gold) to Finn's Redoubt to see about sending a contingent to Hook Mountain and re-opening iron mines formerly run by the Kreegs.  This would allow iron to flow more directly to Riddleport and Magnimar, and would free more Janderhoff iron for Korvosa's use.  With the escalation in hostilities among the four city-states, Axvi is hoping to cash in on the need for steel weapons and armor.  Even without the hostilities, the demand for masterwork quality weapons is high, given the frontier's many dangers.  It was decided that Finn's Redoubt would be a better staging point than Turtleback Ferry, due to the probable reluctance of Turtleback Ferry residents to back an endeavor that could enrage ogres or giants (considering their history).  However, there is no well known path into Hook Mountain from Finn's Redoubt.  One needs to be scouted.

Toma has not sent word about his luck at establishing relations, so Regent Axvi has sent another emissary to see what the problem is, which is Karl's character.  Karl's character is told to find Toma, then deliver word to the priests of Torag in Windsong Abbey that they will be needed to clear and bless the mine and purge it of Ogre influence.  Once that is done, the Regent has released Karl's character to help any way he sees fit, but will be rewarded if he helps clear the mines.  Eventually a new settlement of dwarves will be established at Hook Mountain.

It turns out that Toma was robbed by a Varisian swindle in Finn's Redoubt Inn where he was challenged to a drinking game, but was slipped a drug that knocked him out.  The Varisians "helped" him to his room, and helped themselves to the King's ransom.  They quickly left town after that.  Toma wrote in his diary what had happened, and vowed to make some of the money back any way he could.  Having no money to pay for Hawkdancer to take him to Hook Mountain, he set about doing what he could to earn money.  When he heard about the goblin tracks in the Sanos Forest, he quickly volunteered for the goblin raid, hoping it would lead him to a goblin hoard with treasure that he could then use to pay Hawkdancer.  It turned out to be his undoing.  When the party finds his armor, weapons, and remains, they will find this diary which explains all.

Herzon's letter:

"Brethren in Pain,

    Events here in Finn's Redoubt have transpired according to my visions from Zon-Kuthon, the Midnight Lord and the giver of delicious agony.  I, Herzon the Silent, am his slave, and his vessel.  He has instructed me to document the events starting here in Finn's Redoubt, for great pain, darkness and suffering lay ahead.  I shall offer you the power he has bestowed upon me to lay waste your enemies, if only so that I may be granted a place by which my documentation of all suffering may be thorough and complete.  I ask for nothing more in return.

    Should my end come in my service to you, it will be His will.  Know as well that I must never speak, for my words would surely be tainted and twisted by the endless pain I must endure and witness.  My oath to this end is final.  Asking me to end my oath will only incur my wrath...

    To the people of Finn's Redoubt, I will offer a quote from the Chants of Truth from Chapter 3, Page 70 of The Umbral Leaves:  'Pain is the ONLY teacher.  It focuses the mind, strengthens the body, and separates what is important from what is not.  Embrace your suffering, for it shall cleanse you of all things petty and worthless.'

- Herzon the Silent"

Pylus was a former apprentice turned teacher at Misret Manor.  Pylus is also a loyal Korvosan and was persuaded by Korvosa's Queen to destabilize the region by any means necessary, to prevent dwarven access to Hook Mountain and disrupt the Iron Road.   Using extra strong sleeping potions worked into one night's dinner, he set about assassinating almost the entire host of Misret Manor (save Fyndir, who he left alive to take as a slave)

Pylus found an imprisoned quasit in Misret's quarters named Vugog.  In exchange for release, Vugog agreed to a Familiar oath with Pylus, binding the two.  However, Vugog has since been plotting the death of Pylus, so that he can resume his work trying to destroy the party.

Pylus also double-crossed the leader of the goblins, a bugbear named Malkik.  Pylus feared that Malkik was too strong for him to handle, and thought that it would be easiest to exert direct control over the goblins once Malkik was put aside.  The bugbear was slept, and is now residing in the dungeon below Misret Manor.  The goblins believe Malkik to be dead (that Pylus "disappeared" him with his crafty magic).

Inside Misret Manor currently is Pylus, Vugog, and a few goblin guards (including Blot, the new leader of the goblins).  If there is a battle outside, Pylus will order the Manor locked rather than fight.

Outside Goblin hoard:

    large chest:
        35 pp, 305 gp, 433 sp, 713 cp

Misret Manor hoard:

    hidden, wizard-locked, and dangerously trapped chest:

    treasure hoard in Pylus' room:

        outfits of silk robes and clothing worth 283 gp
        18 pieces of jewelry worth 400 gp
        18 low-level potions of various kinds

        9 X 1st level wizard spell books (250 gp each)
        2 broken wands worth 60 gp

    alchemy lab:
        various alchemical reagents worth 890 gp

    library:
        750 books worth 4000 gp
        box of ink wells and pens
        numerous scrolls and empty books

    Misret's room:
        small conjuration prison used to keep Vugog

    
    

If the party destroys the goblins outside, Pylus will address the party from one of the towers, thanking them for ridding him of the pests he used to kill Misret and lay low Finn's Redoubt.  He will then try to sleep the remaining party members, but Vugog will interrupt him by releasing Malkik.  If the party successfully storms the Manor, Vugog will disappear during the battle, waiting for the party to kill Pylus and Malkik.  Once Pylus and Malkik are killed, Vugog will re-appear and thank the party for freeing him from Pylus, chuckling.  During that chaos, Vugog will steal one of the chakrams to frame Undar with.


Inside the locked chest are notes regarding arcane communications with a person named Hamaeus Ivy, a wizard who seems to be friends of Misret, who specializes in conjuration in Korvosa.  The notes indicate that Vugog had been caught spying on Misret and was captured.  Interrogation revealed nothing except Vugog's name.

Inside the dungeons is one student left alive.  He will offer to join the party, especially if the goal is to get Hamaeus Ivy.  He vouches for Hamaeus' goodwill, honesty and toughness.

Inside the library are records of all students that have passed through Misret Manor, as well as the forwarding addresses for all students who have been killed to notify next-of-kin.

Alias will try to convince the party to find Hamaeus Ivy and get him safely to Misret Manor.  Having Hamaeus run Misret Manor would return a sense of normalcy and security to Finn's Redoubt, especially once it becomes clear that Hamaeus is somewhat trustworthy.

Hamaeus Ivy lives in Korvosa.  If the party travels to Korvosa to find him, he will reluctantly agree to return to Misret Manor to resume Misret's work, as he has grown tired of the life in Korvosa's court.  He had been working in the library of the Acadamae of Korvosa, trying to find other like-minded (good) wizards to recruit to join Magnimar.  However, he believes his dealings have been noticed, and his return to Misret provides the excuse he needs to leave the Acadamae.  Hamaeus is a LG Chelish conjurer, who specializes in summoning celestial hawks. His goal eventually is to learn how to summon a phoenix.  He has a halfling steward named Famson.  Hawkdancer, upon meeting Hamaeus, will announce that Hamaeus was part of a vision quest (calling him the Hawk-bringer) that she had and that she must stay by his side... this is why she abandoned her clan.  The visions, of course, were caused by Krune.

...

Once it becomes clear that the dwarves are intent on opening the mines of Hook Mountain, all three city-states will send overtures to Finn's Redoubt to win fealty.  
	* Riddleport will tempt the people with a naked bribe of gold in exchange for lax rule, low taxes,  and the opening of certain "safehouses" with no questions asked... Alias may remain on as Mayor so long as Riddleport's rulers agree.
	* Magnimar will offer a trade route, a mild troop presence for security, and a seat on the council of Magnimar (which Alias would fill, forcing him to be on leave from town several months out of the year).
	* Korvosa will also open a diplomatic front, offering the most (gold, troops, and offering to make a fort), but will insist on its own leadership.

...


Approaching is the 10th anniversary of Undar's father's death.  Upon returning to Windsong Abbey, Undar's master will graduate him.  He will then produce a letter that arrived just after he left, from Kendra Devarick of Sandpoint.

The letter reads:

"Dear Undar,

It has been too long since I last wrote, and I wish I could be writing with good tidings.  As you know, the ten-year anniversary of your father's death approaches.  Also as you remember, I wrote you several years ago to let you know that the remains of the Old Light Brewery were being demolished, and that your father's urn was relocated from under the brewery to The Arch, where most other citizens urns are enterred.

Unfortunately, last week, there was a break-in at The Arch.  Oddly enough, the only thing taken was your father's urn.  A note was left, but I cannot write its contents here... You must come to Sandpoint so that I may show you the letter.

Regards,

Kendra Devarick"

The urn was stolen by Vugog to determine Undar's whereabouts.  He tracked Kendra's letter to Windsong Abbey, where he then learned of Undar's travel to Misret Manor.  Vugog's note that he leaves says "Tell Undar Oakbarrel that his father is missing.", with no signature.

Vugog buried the urn just outside of Sandpoint.

...

During the reign of the Runelords, the threat of Earthfall's darkness became suddenly real.  All the Runelords constructed Runewells to save themselves from the coming calamity.  The Runelord Alaznist, Empress of Bakrakhan (Realm of Wrath), vowed to return earlier than her rivals and carry out her wrath against them while they slept (especially Karzoug, her sworn enemy). Before she slept, she was warned by Krune, the emperor of Sloth and chief priest of Lissala, that Alaznist would be destroyed by a band of outsiders after her return, orchestrated by Karzoug.  This was a ruse meant to focus her attention away from Krune if he should awaken after her.  He had been plotting the destruction of all the Runelords, and had expected Karzoug and Alaznist to destroy each other.  Earthfall ruined those plans, but provided an opportunity to fool Alaznist.

Krune's Runewell was the first to activate.  His intent was to awaken when his goddess Lisalla to be at her apex of power.  He instead awoke to a strange land and strange people, and found his goddess to be powerless in this new world.  Alone in a new world with no followers and no divine power, Krune used the new world's economy to form new slaves (without them even knowing).  He formed the Aspis Consortium, and directs it from a tower in Absalom.  With his new-found power, he can now set about the destruction of the other Runelords.  His first target is Alaznist, since she is the most powerful, unreasonable, and paranoid.

He first set about finding the right party to confront, or at least weaken, Alaznist.  Through directives via the Aspis Consortium, Krune organized and orchestrated events to get the party together in Finn's Redoubt. Using rune magic, he empowered Herzon to develop psionic powers, and entered his dreams posing as Zon-Kuthon.  He convinced Undar's master to send Undar to Finn's Redoubt through dreams.  He started the Black Orchid to develop assassin talent, and picking one to arrive in Varisia as needed.  He caused dreams to convince Hawkdancer that she needed to wait for a man she would come to know as "Hawk-bringer"... this became her vision quest. He counseled the Queen of Korvosa (through the Aspis Consortium) to take over Misret Manor as a task for the newly assembled party to become acquainted.  Once settled on a party, he awakened Alaznist by travelling to her Runewell and activating it, then disappearing before she was aware, but not before leaving clues as to the existence of her prophesied killers.

After awakening Alaznist, Krune will keep tabs on the party through a number of means (scrying, Aspis Consortium, Black Orchid, etc).  He will send an Aspis agent dressed as a Kuthite to collect Herzon's books occasionally.  He will occasionally help the party through various means (his lamia hunters in Viperwall who have been awakened, Black Orchid, Aspis). 

Alaznist awoke to the same world, and remembered Krune's warning.  She decided that her wrath against Karzoug could wait, and focused on the prevention of her own death first.  She worked slowly on growing a network of spies, both invisible and those susceptible to mind control, and slowly advanced her reach into the new world.  Nine years ago, she learned of Undar and the prescence of other Outsider blood in Sandpoint (Tieflings, Aasimars, etc.) via an agent Jervas Stoot, whom she had sent (via Runemagic mind control) to kill those with traces of Outsider lineage.  Jervas Stoot meant to kill Undar, but killed Undar's father instead.  The Sandpoint City Watch dispatched of the murderer before he could find Undar.  The mayor of Sandpoint, being given the idea by an Aspis agent, convinced Undar to go to Windsong Abbey.  That threw Alaznist off Undar's trail.  

Alaznist, starting to regain some semblance of her power, summoned a silent and fast investigator, Vugog the Quasit to track down and kill Undar and his friends.  Vugog learned of Undar's mission to visit Misret Manor by spying in Windsong Abbey.  After arriving at Misret's Manor, Vugog was unaware of the wizard's safeguards and was caught by Misret.  Misret never did figure out Vugog's purpose, but he did try.

Vugog will also convince Ugpo Kreeg, the last of the Kreeg ogres, that he has been attacked by Undar by using one of the chakrams against him, then fleeing, leaving traces of Undar's smell, clothing, and fake footprints leading back to Finn's Redoubt. 

Vugog will continuously try to gain allies and blame all misdeeds on Undar & company.  Vugog will eventually confront the party from a position of strength, once he feels he has a powerful enough ally.
 
Ugpo will lie in wait just outside Finn's Redoubt, and will attack Undar the moment he arrives.  Or if it better fits the situation, Ugpo will hold one of the villagers hostage until "the owner of the chakram" (Undar) arrives.
