Once it becomes clear that the dwarves are intent on opening the mines of Hook Mountain, all three city-states will send overtures to Finn's Redoubt to win fealty.  
	* Riddleport will tempt the people with a naked bribe of gold in exchange for lax rule, low taxes,  and the opening of certain "safehouses" with no questions asked... Alias may remain on as Mayor so long as Riddleport's rulers agree.
	* Magnimar will offer a trade route, a mild troop presence for security, and a seat on the council of Magnimar (which Alias would fill, forcing him to be on leave from town several months out of the year).
	* Korvosa will also open a diplomatic front, offering the most (gold, troops, and offering to make a fort), but will insist on its own leadership.

Approaching is the 10th anniversary of Undar's father's death.  Upon returning to Windsong Abbey, Undar's master will graduate him.  He will then produce a letter that arrived just after he left, from Kendra Devarick of Sandpoint.

The letter reads:

"Dear Undar,

It has been too long since I last wrote, and I wish I could be writing with good tidings.  As you know, the ten-year anniversary of your father's death approaches.  Also as you remember, I wrote you several years ago to let you know that the remains of the Old Light Brewery were being demolished, and that your father's urn was relocated from under the brewery to The Arch, where most other citizens urns are enterred.

Unfortunately, last week, there was a break-in at The Arch.  Oddly enough, the only thing taken was your father's urn.  A note was left, but I cannot write its contents here... You must come to Sandpoint so that I may show you the letter.

Regards,

Kendra Devarick"

During the reign of the Runelords, the threat of Earthfall's darkness became suddenly real.  All the Runelords constructed Runewells to save themselves from the coming calamity.  The Runelord Alaznist, Empress of Bakrakhan (Realm of Wrath), vowed to return earlier than her rivals and carry out her wrath against them while they slept (especially Karzoug, her sworn enemy). Before she slept, she was warned by Krune, the emperor of Sloth and chief priest of Lissala, that Alaznist would be destroyed by a band of outsiders after her return, orchestrated by Karzoug.  This was a ruse meant to focus her attention away from Krune if he should awaken after her.  He had been plotting the destruction of all the Runelords, and had expected Karzoug and Alaznist to destroy each other.  Earthfall ruined those plans, but provided an opportunity to fool Alaznist.

Krune's Runewell was the first to activate.  His intent was to awaken when his goddess Lisalla to be at her apex of power.  He instead awoke to a strange land and strange people, and found his goddess to be powerless in this new world.  Alone in a new world with no followers and no divine power, Krune used the new world's economy to form new slaves (without them even knowing).  He formed the Aspis Consortium, and directs it from a tower in Absalom.  With his new-found power, he can now set about the destruction of the other Runelords.  His first target is Alaznist, since she is the most powerful, unreasonable, and paranoid.

He first set about finding the right party to confront, or at least weaken, Alaznist.  Through directives via the Aspis Consortium, Krune organized and orchestrated events to get the party together in Finn's Redoubt. Using rune magic, he empowered Herzon to develop psionic powers, and entered his dreams posing as Zon-Kuthon.  He convinced Undar's master to send Undar to Finn's Redoubt through dreams.  He started the Black Orchid to develop assassin talent, and picking one to arrive in Varisia as needed.  He caused dreams to convince Hawkdancer that she needed to wait for a man she would come to know as "Hawk-bringer"... this became her vision quest. He counseled the Queen of Korvosa (through the Aspis Consortium) to take over Misret Manor as a task for the newly assembled party to become acquainted.  Once settled on a party, he awakened Alaznist by travelling to her Runewell and activating it, then disappearing before she was aware, but not before leaving clues as to the existence of her prophesied killers.

After awakening Alaznist, Krune will keep tabs on the party through a number of means (scrying, Aspis Consortium, Black Orchid, etc).  He will send an Aspis agent dressed as a Kuthite to collect Herzon's books occasionally.  He will occasionally help the party through various means (his lamia hunters in Viperwall who have been awakened, Black Orchid, Aspis). 

Alaznist awoke to the same world, and remembered Krune's warning.  She decided that her wrath against Karzoug could wait, and focused on the prevention of her own death first.  She worked slowly on growing a network of spies, both invisible and those susceptible to mind control, and slowly advanced her reach into the new world.  Nine years ago, she learned of Undar and the prescence of other Outsider blood in Sandpoint (Tieflings, Aasimars, etc.) via an agent Jervas Stoot, whom she had sent (via Runemagic mind control) to kill those with traces of Outsider lineage.  Jervas Stoot meant to kill Undar, but killed Undar's father instead.  The Sandpoint City Watch dispatched of the murderer before he could find Undar.  The mayor of Sandpoint, being given the idea by an Aspis agent, convinced Undar to go to Windsong Abbey.  That threw Alaznist off Undar's trail.  

Alaznist, starting to regain some semblance of her power, summoned a silent and fast investigator, Vugog the Quasit to track down and kill Undar and his friends.  Vugog learned of Undar's mission to visit Misret Manor by spying in Windsong Abbey.  After arriving at Misret's Manor, Vugog was unaware of the wizard's safeguards and was caught by Misret.  Misret never did figure out Vugog's purpose, but he did try.

Vugog will also convince Ugpo Kreeg, the last of the Kreeg ogres, that he has been attacked by Undar by using one of the chakrams against him, then fleeing, leaving traces of Undar's smell, clothing, and fake footprints leading back to Finn's Redoubt. 

Vugog will continuously try to gain allies and blame all misdeeds on Undar & company.  Vugog will eventually confront the party from a position of strength, once he feels he has a powerful enough ally.
 
Ugpo will lie in wait just outside Finn's Redoubt, and will attack Undar the moment he arrives.  Or if it better fits the situation, Ugpo will hold one of the villagers hostage until "the owner of the chakram" (Undar) arrives.
